Here is a test project that will give an idea what we do.  (see attached)

If it works well, we will get you in to walk us through your solution.

Please upload to git and share the repository link.

Requirements:

Restful API:
·        Design and implement a RESTful API using Java Spring Boot.

Swagger Documentation:
·        Integrate Swagger to generate API documentation automatically.

·        Ensure that all endpoints, request parameters, and responses are well-documented using Swagger annotations.

Database CRUD Layer with MSSQL:
·        Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the database.

·        Utilize MSSQL as the database backend to store and retrieve data.

What would you do to enhance performance of your project?


What additional enhancements would add to the project to make it more complete ?
Note : You are creating a microservice that relates to the sensitive words.
Another system/or microservice is going to send your micro service a string and you need to return the sanitized string.
Example :
Request to your API  : {“input” : “You need to create a string” }
Response from your API : {“output” : “You need to ****** a string”}

The rest of the CRUD layer will be used to managing the sensitive words.
